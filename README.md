# lv2rdf2html
(C) 2017 by JÃ¶rn Nettingsmeier. This transform is licensed under the
GNU General Public License v3.

lv2rdf2html automatically generates HTML/jQuery GUIs for LV2 audio
plugins. The original usecase is to control plugin instances running
on embedded systems in a [mod-host](
https://github.com/moddevices/mod-host), but it can be adapted to
other uses easily.

The conversion is done with XSL transformations. This means that the 
LV2 metadata must be converted to XML first.

This stylesheet has been developed and tested with RDF/XML generated in the 
following way:
  
* Gather URI information of available plugins:
```
#~> lv2ls
```
* Collect plugin documentation in a Turtle file (lv2info appends to a file):
```
#~> rm output.ttl
#~> lv2info -p output.ttl http://gareus.org/oss/lv2/fil4#stereo
#~> lv2info -p output.ttl http://calf.sourceforge.net/plugins/Compressor
    ...
```
* Convert the turtle file to RDF/XML:
  * Using [rdf2rdf](http://www.l3s.de/~minack/rdf2rdf/):
  ```
  #~> java -jar rdf2rdf-1.0.1-2.3.1.jar output.ttl output.xml
  ```
  * Using [rapper](http://librdf.org/raptor/rapper.html) (part of raptor/Redland):
  ```
  #~> rapper -o rdfxml -i turtle output.ttl > output2.xml
  ```
* Apply this stylesheet and prettyprint:
```
#~> xsltproc lv2rdf2html.xsl output.xml | xsltproc xml-prettyprint.xsl - > output.html
#~> xsltproc lv2rdf2html.xsl output2.xml | xsltproc xml-prettyprint.xsl - > output2.html
```
It currently tries to support all LV2 features used by the plugins listed above.

## Requirements

* LV2 plugins installed on your system,
* the LV2 tools lv2ls and lv2info,
* an XSLT 1.0  processor such as 
  * xsltproc or 
  * saxon,
* a Turtle-to-XML RDF converter, such as
  * [rapper](http://librdf.org/raptor/rapper.html) or
  * [rdf2rdf](http://www.l3s.de/~minack/rdf2rdf/).
* [mod-host](https://github.com/moddevices/mod-host), and
* a PHP-capable webserver

## Status

Currently, lv2rdf2html produces a non-functional mockup GUI and is able to
query the current state of plugins running in mod-host.
    
## Notes

Rdf2rdf and rapper produce different RDF/XML: rdf2r2f tries to collate
triplets (but does a horrible job of doing it in a consistent way), and rapper
does the simple, clean thing of keeping every single triplet separate. Both work
because the stylesheet doesn't make any assumptions about them being grouped, 
that's why it's soo terrible.
  
There is a very clean alternative converter at http://www.easyrdf.org/converter
which appears to do perfect grouping, but I'm a bit wary of supporting it because
it requires PHP, fails to include namespace prefixes and seems to make a few risky guesses...
