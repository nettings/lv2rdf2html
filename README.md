# lv2rdf2html
(C) 2017 by JÃ¶rn Nettingsmeier. This transform and all helper scripts and
code is licensed under the BSD 3-Clause license.

lv2rdf2html automatically generates HTML/jQuery GUIs for LV2 audio
plugins. The original usecase is to control plugin instances running
on embedded systems in a [mod-host](
https://github.com/moddevices/mod-host), but it can be adapted to
other uses easily.

The conversion is done with XSL transformations. This means that the 
LV2 metadata must be converted to XML first.

## Usage

### Automatic processing with generate.sh
The [generate.sh](generate.sh) script operates on a mod-host command history, and
automatically generates and deploys all required components. To use it, please edit the settings in
[lv2rdf.conf](lv2rdf.conf).

The generator script will then
* Collect the desired plugin documentation in a temporary Turtle file using lv2info
* Convert the turtle file to a temporary RDF/XML file using [rapper](http://librdf.org/raptor/rapper.html)
(part of raptor/Redland, this is what I use for testing). 
* Generate, prettyprint and deploy a HTML file
* Generate and deploy a corresponding Javascript file
* Generate and deploy the PHP AJAX handler
* Deploy a corresponding (minimal) CSS file

The deploy.sh script is deprecated and does not reflect the current state of
affairs.

### Manual processing on the command line

For development and debugging, the generation process can be done entirely
manually.
* Gather URI information of available plugins:
```
#~> lv2ls
```
* Collect the desired plugin documentation in a Turtle file (lv2info appends to a file):
```
#~> rm output.ttl
#~> lv2info -p output.ttl http://gareus.org/oss/lv2/fil4#stereo
#~> lv2info -p output.ttl http://calf.sourceforge.net/plugins/Compressor
    ...
```
* Convert the turtle file to RDF/XML:
  * Using [rapper](http://librdf.org/raptor/rapper.html) (part of
    raptor/Redland, this is what I use for testing):
  ```
  #~> rapper -o rdfxml -i turtle output.ttl > output.xml
  ```
  * Using [rdf2rdf](http://www.l3s.de/~minack/rdf2rdf/) (I'm testing this
every once in a while, but expect hiccups):
  ```
  #~> java -jar rdf2rdf-1.0.1-2.3.1.jar output.ttl output.xml
  ```
* Generate the HTML page and prettyprint:
```
#~> xsltproc \
	--stringparam jsuri lv2rdf.js \ 
	--stringparam cssuri lv2rdf.css \
	lv2rdf2html.xsl output.xml \
	| xsltproc xml-prettyprint.xsl - \
		> lv2rdf.html
```
* Generate the PHP AJAX handler:
```
#~> xsltproc \
	--stringparam host "<your mod-host hostname>" \
	--param port "<the port mod-host is listening on>" \
	lv2rdf2php.xsl output.xml \
	> lv2rdf.php
```
* Generate the Javascript code:
```
#~> xsltproc \
	--stringparam ajaxuri lv2rdf.php \
	lv2rdf2js.xsl output.xml > lv2rdf.js
```

* Deploy everything to a PHP-enabled webserver, including the CSS and
Javascript. 
The [deployment script](deploy.sh) tries to be clever about this
and auto-deploys whenever you modify a file on disk. It is currently broken
and deprecated.
* Generate the Javascript code:
```
#~> xsltproc \
	--stringparam ajaxuri lv2rdf.php \
	lv2rdf2js.xsl output.xml > lv2rdf.js
```

## Requirements

* LV2 plugins installed on your system,
* the LV2 tools lv2ls and lv2info,
* an XSLT 1.0  processor such as 
  * xsltproc or 
  * saxon (currently unsupported unless you process manually),
* a Turtle-to-XML RDF converter, such as
  * [rapper](http://librdf.org/raptor/rapper.html) or
  * [rdf2rdf](http://www.l3s.de/~minack/rdf2rdf/).
* [mod-host](https://github.com/moddevices/mod-host), and
* a PHP-capable webserver
* (optional) inotify-tools for automated deployment

## Status

lv2rdf2html currently supports all LV2 features used by the plugins
listed above. As bugs are shaken out, more plugins will be added to the 
testing environment. 
The generated web GUI is fully functional and interacts with a configurable
mod-host instance, with a few missing features listed in the [TODO](TODO.md) 
file that do not impede basic usability. 
    
## Notes

Rdf2rdf and rapper produce different RDF/XML: rdf2rdf tries to collate
triplets (but does a horrible job of doing it in a consistent way), and rapper
does the simple, clean thing of keeping every single triplet separate. Both work
because the stylesheet doesn't make any assumptions about them being grouped, 
that's why it's soo terrible.
  
There is a very clean alternative converter at http://www.easyrdf.org/converter
which appears to do perfect grouping, but I'm a bit wary of supporting it because
it requires PHP, fails to include namespace prefixes and seems to make a few risky guesses...

Sometimes, the generated UI is not very nice to use because of deficiencies
in this code, and sometimes because the plugin's metadata is sub-optimal.
Calf is a bad example here, it does much usability magic in its GUI and
exposes ports with coefficient gains rather than logarithmic. I hope I can
get a few of these issues fixed upstream as the project matures.
